This scrapper/scanner logs into a Upwork account using selenium for the login process, catches all the jobs which are in the main page through a local file created with python and consumed with BeautifoulSoup. Then it navigates to the profile page with selenium, extracts certain information about the profile owner using BeautifoulSoup. Finally, I used pydantic to model the  scrapped data and export it into a JSON file.

I also used mypy, flake8 and pytest for checks, linting and testing, besides of typer to facilitate easy and expandable interaction with the CLI.

### Installation

All the dependencies and sub-dependencies will be installed on the local project.

```bash
pip install poetry
```

```bash
poetry install
```

## Linting and Checks

Type checker.

```bash
mypy .
```

Linting tool for checking pep8 recommendations.
